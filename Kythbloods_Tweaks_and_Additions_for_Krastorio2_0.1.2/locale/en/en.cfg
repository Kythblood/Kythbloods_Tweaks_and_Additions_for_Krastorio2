kyth-small-warehouse=Adds a smaller version (4x4) of the K2 warehouse.

kyth-reorder=Reorders some items and recipes from Krastorio 2 and other mods.
kyth-angels-mobility-changes=Makes changes to Angels mobility to increase combatibility with Krastorio 2.\nMakes the different kinds of locomotives and wagons more unique, for example makes the Smelting train stronger, heavier and less fuel efficient etc.\nAlso applies the Fluid wagon capacity setting of this mod and the Cargo wagon capacity bonus of Krastorio 2 to new entities.
kyth-angels-mobility-combatibility-script-fix= An updated version of Krastorio 2 combatibility scripts for "Angel's Addons - Mass Transit". The 3 seperate Angels mods have been combined into "Angel's Addons - Mass Transit", but Krastorio 2 has not updated its scripts to account for that change.\nIf this gets fixed in Krastorio 2 at some point in the future, disable this option.
kyth-massive-fluid-storage-tank=Adds a 7x5 fluid storage tank that can store up to 500k of fluid. Perfect for train unloading and loading.\nExperimental: not yet possible to rotate because the creation of a sprite for vertical orientation is still in progress.\n[color=#cccccc]Default: disabled[/color]

kyth-nuclear-locomotive-buff=Makes a slight buff to the top speed of the nuclear locomotive because of the missing Vehicle acceleration bonus of the Uranium fuel cells the nuclear locomotive acutally has a lower max speed    then a normal locomotive with good fuel.
kyth-steel-pipe-capacity=Changes the steel pipe capacity.\nThe default value for the Krastorio 2's steel pipe is 1.25 (= 125), meaning +25% increase compared to a vanilla pipe. It is worth mentioning that the actual increase of throughput during normal gameplay is a few percent lower than this value. \n[color=#cccccc]Default: 1.25[/color]
